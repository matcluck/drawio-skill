# Icons

Place icon files here for use in diagrams (PNG, WebP, SVG).

The skill will discover available icons at runtime and offer them during requirements gathering. Icons larger than 128KB will be automatically resized to 512x512px before use.

At the end of diagram generation, all `file:///` icon references are embedded as base64 for portability.
